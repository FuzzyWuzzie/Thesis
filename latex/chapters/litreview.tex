			\begin{itemize}
				\item Compression induced damage and internal tissue strains are related \cite{ceelen08}
				\item Microstructural analusis of deformation-induced hypoxic damage in skeletal muscle \cite{ceelen08-8}
				\item How does muscle stiffness affect the internal deformatins within the soft tissue layers of the buttocks under constant loading? \cite{loerakker13}
				\item A theoretical model to study the effects of cellular stiffening on the damage eveolution in deep tissue injury \cite{nagel09}
				\item The biomechanics of sitting-acquired pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury or lesions \cite{gefen07-9}
				\item Assessment of mechanical conditions in sub-dermal tissues during sitting: a combined expeirmental-MRI and finite-element approach \cite{linderganz06}
				\item Mechanical gluteal soft tissue material parameter validation under complex tissue loading \cite{then09}
				\item Diffusion of water in skeletal muscle tissue is not influenced by compression in a rat model of deep tissue injury \cite{vanNierop10}.
