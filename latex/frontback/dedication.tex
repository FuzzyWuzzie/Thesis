\chapter*{Dedication}
	This work was written for all those who have lovingly supported me throughout it's creation.

	To my mother Meridel, who instilled in me the desire to always better myself and persist through the greatest of difficulties. Even when things got difficult, you gently pushed me to continue even to your own detriment.

	To my late father David, who taught me about the world and inspired my combination of creativity, critical analysis, and work ethic. I wasn't able to finish before he left us, but I know he would be proud of what I accomplished in the end.

	To my beautiful wife Dennie, who has stood by me and loved me without condition in the face of adversity and struggle. Without you, I would have given up long ago. You supported me above all others and this work exists as much because of you as it does because of me.
